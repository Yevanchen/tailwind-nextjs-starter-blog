# Getting Started

Milkdown is a lightweight but powerful WYSIWYG markdown editor. It consists of two parts:

- A tiny core which provides a plugin loader and all kinds of internal plugins.
- Lots of additional plugins provide syntax, commands and components.

With this pattern you can enable or disable any custom syntax and feature you like, such as table, latex and tooltip. You can also create your own plugin to support your awesome idea.

> 🍼 **Fun fact**: The Milkdown documentation is rendered by milkdown itself!
